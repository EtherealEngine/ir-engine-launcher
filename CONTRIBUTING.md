### Code Standards

We currently have strict formatting rules for all `.ts` and `.tsx` files. Please use the `npm run format` hook before making a commit to ensure the rules are adhered to. The commit hook will fail if the formatter has not been run and there are formatting issues.

### Pull Request Process

If you are part of the XREngine development team, please create branches on ths repository, otherwise create a fork and branches to PR.

Ensure any extraneous local project files, installs or build dependencies are removed before making a PR. You may make a seperate PR for adding to the .gitignore.

Before merging in any Pull Request, ensure that all checks pass, particularly the workflow/compile-codebase check. This ensures that the codebase will continue to build and deploy successfully.

You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

### Building new versions
